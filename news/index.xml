      <description>Many people are excited about WebAssembly, which lets you use languages other than JavaScript on the web. With WebAssembly, you can run C, C++, Rust, Zig, Go, or pretty much anything that compiles to LLVM in a sandbox running inside your web browser. This has performance costs, but many people are working on highly optimized JIT compilers designed to minimize these costs as much as possible.
